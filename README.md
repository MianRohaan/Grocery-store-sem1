# Grocery-store-sem1

Problem:
You have to develop an online Grocery Store. Your system should be able to store data related to the
grocery items as well as the users. The details of the items must be maintained to develop a repository.
The system should be able to generate bills for the customers and update the repository whenever there
is a sale transaction. Furthermore, the system should be able to prompt if a certain item runs out so that
the manager may decide for timely reinforcements.
You are required to do the following:
1) Start by reading data (i.e. grocery items) from a file which would contain the details as shown
below. Set a limit to the number of items to be stored in the e-store (say 50). Every item may or
may not have a fixed number of quantity available (say 50 boxes/bottles/packs). Once you
upload the data, you can now work on the successive parts respectively. (10 Marks)
The information related to the item(s) is as follows:
 Product ID
 Product Name
 Weight
 Mfg date
 Exp date
 Price (per pack/per bottle)
 Quantity
2) Now that you have the data available with you, you must implement the following
functionalities for the customer: (20 Marks)
 Search an item in the repository (also show its expiry date and price)
 Insert an item in the cart (if available)
 Delete an item from the cart
 Update quantity of an item (increase or decrease)
 Get user details (i.e. Name, Address and Contact Number before check-out)
 Add tax and delivery charges on the finalized order.
Remember these functionalities will be used time and again so you need to use appropriate
programming practices. Furthermore, system should prompt the user once an item runs out of
quantity.
3) Now that the system is ready for the sale transactions. The system should be able to display bills
for the purchased quantities inculcating tax amount and discounts (if any). The same receipt
should be output to a file (display in a nicer format i.e. tabular form) so that the customer may
get a print-out. (10 Marks)
Bonus Tasks:
a. Offer a discount of 20% to the Loyal Customers (a customer with more than 5 orders).
b. If the order exceeds 10000PKR, delivery charges may be waived off.
c. Try to inculcate GUI (i.e. Graphical User Interface) as much as possible.
